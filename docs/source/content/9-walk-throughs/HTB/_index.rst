HackTheBox
==========
`HackTheBox`_ is probably the most widely-known platform for Capture The Flag challenges, featuring a fully-managed network of vulnerable systems. They offer both free and paid services. The free service provides access to all currently-active challenges, while the paid service provides additional access to all retired challenges, as well as lower-latency connections to the VPN.

.. note::

    As per the Terms of Service, walk-throughs are not allowed to be published for currently-active machines. Therefore, the following walk-throughs focus on retired machines.

    To gain access to these retired machines, you'll need a VIP account on HackTheBox. VIP accounts are not free, but they are not prohibitively expensive, and offer many advantages over the free account.
