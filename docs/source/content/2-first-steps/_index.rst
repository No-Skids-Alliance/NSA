.. index:: !Legacy (HackTheBox)

In this section, we'll get started with a hands-on walk-through of a fairly easy `HackTheBox`_ target: `Legacy`.

.. note::

    If you wish to hack this machine yourself, you'll need a VIP account with HackTheBox. VIP accounts are not free, but they are not prohibitively expensive, and offer many advantages over the free account.

    Creating an account on HackTheBox is a little more complicated than on most websites, as they require you to hack their sign-up process. We urge you to attempt to solve this puzzle on your own, but if you struggle with this step, there are numerous guides on the internet for how to hack the sign-up process. Remember: Google is your greatest asset!

This walk-through, as with all the others throughout the guide, is cross-referenced with other sections of the guide, as well as with third-party websites were additional information can be found. These cross-references allow you to dive deeper into the various concepts and tools explored in the walk-through, should you wish to learn more.
