General Knowledge
=================
The subject of computer hacking is vast and deep, allowing for endless exploration and specialism. There is, however, a shared foundation of general knowledge upon which nearly everything depends. At a minimum, a computer hacker should know how to operate a computer and connect to the Internet, as well as how to write software or scripts. A familiarity with internet search engines is also essential. (These topics will be covered in more depth in the :ref:`The Hacker's Toolkit <toolkit>`.)

It is also useful to study the `OSI model`_ and `Internet protocol suite`_ (TCP/IP) in order to understand how the Internet works and how systems communicate with each other. `TCP`_ and `UDP`_ are also worth studying, as they're the most common network communication protocols currently in use.
