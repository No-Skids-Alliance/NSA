Metasploit
==========
Originally written in Perl in 2003, the `Metasploit Project`_ grew swiftly in popularity among hackers worldwide. By the time it was re-written in Ruby in 2007, it was already one of the most controversial and widely-used hacking tools on the 'net.

Many hackers have scorned the tool, claiming it gives script-kiddies easy access to weaponized exploits. Despite this claim, Metasploit has proven its value over the years, becoming a mainstay in hacking distributions like :index:`Kali Linux`, as well as the subject of many books.

Despite its popularity, the original criticism still stands: Metasploit makes it remarkably easy for unskilled individuals to break into remote systems. It simplifies the exploitation process, saving time and effort for ethical and unethical hackers alike. However, the same simplicity can translate into laziness. If you use Metasploit for every attack, you'll only ever learn how to use Metasploit.

A skilled hacker knows that Metasploit is just one tool among many. Tools like Metasploit automate the exploitation process, but are limited to the exploits their developers have released. If a vulnerability exists, but a Metasploit module hasn't yet been released, then manual exploitation will be necessary.

For this reason, while Metasploit will be used throughout this guide, it will be used sparingly. Wherever possible, manual exploitation methods will be detailed. Finally, this guide does not include an introduction to Metasploit; if you'd like to learn the ins and outs of this particular tool, consider reading the `Metasploit Official Documentation`_ or one of the many guides available online.
