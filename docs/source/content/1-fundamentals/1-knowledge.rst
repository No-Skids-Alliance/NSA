General Knowledge
=================
The subject of computer :index:`hacking` is vast and deep, allowing for endless exploration and specialism. There is, however, a shared foundation of general knowledge upon which nearly everything depends. At a minimum, a computer :index:`hacker` should know how to operate a computer and connect to the Internet, as well as how to write software or scripts. A familiarity with internet search engines is also essential. (These topics will be covered in more depth in the :ref:`The Hacker's Toolkit <toolkit>`.)

It is also useful to study the `OSI model`_ and `Internet protocol suite`_ (TCP/IP) in order to understand how the Internet works and how systems communicate with each other. `TCP`_ and `UDP`_ are also worth studying, as they're the most common network communication protocols currently in use.

Pentest Methodology
-------------------
As in other areas of engineering and science, pentesting is most effective when based on the foundation of a solid methodology. A variety of penetration testing methodologies have been published, each outlining a set of phases and objectives. These methodologies help ensure a thorough, comprehensive test, and help hackers maximize their effectiveness.

One of the most basic and widely-recognized standards is the `Penetration Testing Execution Standard`_ (PTES). Other standards, such as the `Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual`_ (OSSTMM) or the `Penetration Testing Framework`_ (PTF), are widely-used as well.
