Ethics
======

The art of :index:`hacking <hack>` can be legally and ethically ambiguous at times. For professionals, proper permission can make the difference between a paycheck and a prison term. :index:`Pentesters <penetration tester>` must work within the boundaries of a defined :index:`scope`, which provides the parameters and restrictions of the :index:`penetration test`. Violating the scope of a penetration test can lead to dire legal consequences.

However, legality isn't the only consideration that :index:`hackers <hacker>` should make. That which is legal is not always ethical, and that which is ethical is not always legal. It is vital that hackers consider the ethics of their actions, and the potential consequences those actions may have in the world.
