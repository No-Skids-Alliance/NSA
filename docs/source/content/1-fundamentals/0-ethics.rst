Ethics
======

The art of :index:`hacking <hack>` can be legally and ethically ambiguous at times. For professionals, proper permission can make the difference between a paycheck and a prison term. :index:`Pentesters <penetration tester>` must work within the boundaries of a defined :index:`scope`, which provides the parameters and restrictions of the :index:`penetration test`. Violating the scope of a penetration test can lead to dire legal consequences.

However, legality isn't the only consideration that :index:`hackers <hacker>` should make. That which is legal is not always ethical, and that which is ethical is not always legal. It is vital that hackers consider the ethics of their actions, and the potential consequences those actions may have in the world.

The subject of ethics weighs heavily into discussions about the disclosure of :index:`vulnerabilities <vulnerability>`, :index:`hacktivism`, state-sponsored cyber-warfare, "hack-back" legislation, and many others. These subjects have been debated for decades, and will likely continue to be debated for decades to come. While this guide won't be diving too deeply into the ethics involved in hacking, its authors wish to stress that `your choices are your own`. If you plan to pursue hacking, whether as a hobby or as a profession, it is vital that you take the time to understand the ethical issues surrounding the topic.

The authors of this guide urge its readers to cultivate and abide by a strong code of personal ethics, not just for hacking, but for life.
