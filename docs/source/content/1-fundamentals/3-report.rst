Reporting
---------
The last step in the Scientific Method is perhaps the most important step of all. Without proper documentation, an experiment is pointless. After every :index:`pentest <penetration test>` is concluded, the :index:`pentester <penetration tester>` submits a :index:`report` detailing the results of the test. The report typically includes two primary sections:

* Executive Summary: A non-technical overview aimed at management.
* Detailed Report: An in-depth technical record of the engagement.

When a client purchases a penetration test, they're paying for the report. As such, the report should be comprehensive and well-crafted. Yet many pentesters wait until after the test is concluded to begin writing their report, working from memory. It's common practice to take extensive notes and screenshots during a penetration test, and many hackers use screen-recording software to take video captures of their pentesting engagements. These methods help supplement memory, allowing the pentester to write a better report. Still, writing the report is a daunting exercise, and the quality tends to suffer when the report is compiled all at once.

Recall that a pentest is basically the Scientific Method on a loop.



The last step of the Scientific Method is to communicate results. In effect, the assembled pentest report comprises a series of smaller reports, each contributing to an overall understanding of the client's security strengths and weaknesses. Each of those smaller reports should be written `as the pentest is conducted`, at the conclusion of each loop.

If you're pentesting a network of computers, your final report will represent the network as a whole. However, the report will effectively be a set of smaller reports, one per system. And each system's report will be a set of smaller reports, one for each exploit used to compromise the system. This is because each exploit is an experiment, nested within a system-wide experiment, nested within a network-wide experiment.

There



overlook the fact that the scientific method applies to each step of the :index:`pentest <penetration test>` process as well. Pentesters often don't begin writing the pentest report until after the test is concluded.

until a penetration test is concluded before they write their report, keeping only cursory notes throughout the testing process. Some create screen-recordings of the penetration test, enabling them to retrace their steps and grab still images from the video.
