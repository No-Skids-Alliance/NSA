Once you've gained access to a Windows target, you'll want to begin exploring the environment to discover as much information as you can. The information you discover can help you to elevate privileges, compromise running services, and potentially pivot into other systems on the network.

The following sections outline various techniques and commands useful on `Windows` systems for post-exploitation activities.


Basic Commands
--------------
.. note::

    When using the path of a directory or filename in the `Windows` command-line, you should always surround the path with "quotation marks" if the path contains any spaces. (e.g. ``"C:\Program Files(x86)\"``)

* ``cd [DIRECTORY]``: Change to the specified directory.
* ``dir [DIRECTORY]``: List the contents of the specified directory. If no direcory is specified, list the contents of the current directory.
* ``type [FILE PATH]``: Print the contents of the specified file to the screen. (Similar to the ``cat`` command on Unix-like systems.)
