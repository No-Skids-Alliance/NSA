Basic Commands
==============
.. note::

    When using the path of a directory or filename in the `Windows` command-line, you should always surround the path with "quotation marks" if the path contains any spaces. (e.g. ``"C:\Program Files(x86)\"``)

* ``cd [DIRECTORY]``: Change to the specified directory.
* ``dir [DIRECTORY]``: List the contents of the specified directory. If no direcory is specified, list the contents of the current directory.
* ``type [FILE PATH]``: Print the contents of the specified file to the screen. (Similar to the ``cat`` command on Unix-like systems.)
