What is the `Metasploit Framework`?
-----------------------------------
Originally created by `H.D. Moore <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Moore>`_ in 2003, the `Metasploit Framework` (MSF) is one of the most widely-used and controversial tools in the modern hacker's arsenal. It simplifies the process of developing and executing exploit code against remote target machines. Many have labeled MSF a tool for "script kiddies," because it contains a plethora of easy-to-use, weaponized exploits that require very little effort to deploy. Despite this claim, `Metasploit` has become a mainstay in the Information Security community, and is included in nearly every mainstream Linux distribution aimed at penetration testing.


.. warning::

    Despite its popularity, the original criticism still stands: MSF makes it remarkably simple for unskilled individuals to break into remote systems. As such, it can easily become a crutch for those who use it exclusively. If you only use `Metasploit`, you only learn `Metasploit`, and when you come face-to-face with a vulnerability for which no `Metasploit` module exists, you'll be stumped. For this reason, the authors urge you to find non-`Metasploit` methods of execution whenever possible. These "manual" methods (as opposed to `Metasploit`'s "automated" method) will help you grow in knowledge and skill, and they'll make you a stronger hacker overall.


How does it work?
-----------------
The `Metasploit Framework` includes a comprehensive suite of Ruby scripts that simplify the development of exploits and payloads targeting remote systems. `Metasploit` is commonly shipped "batteries included," meaning that it comes with a large array of exploits and payloads built-in. It also includes a number of other useful features, including tools for enumeration, vulnerability scanning, documentation, and more. The free version, included in most pentesting-focused Linux distributions, uses a command-line interface for selecting and executing exploits and payloads.


Using `Metasploit`
------------------
The `Metasploit Framework` is such a diverse and powerful toolkit that a thorough enumeration of its functionality is beyond the scope of this document. For those who wish to dive deeper into this tool, there are many books and guides available, including the `Official Documentation <https://metasploit.help.rapid7.com/docs>`_ by `Rapid7 <https://www.rapid7.com/>`_, and the `Metasploit Unleashed <https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/>`_ course by `Offensive Security <https://www.offensive-security.com/>`_.

For the purposes of this document, we'll include only the most commonly-used functions within the MSF.
