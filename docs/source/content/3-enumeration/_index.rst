Enumeration
===========

*Enumeration* is the process of gathering useful information about a target. This is essential at the start of a penetration test, where the goal is to learn as much about the target as you can. The information gathered in this phase will lay the groundwork for the rest of the penetration test. However, this isn't the only time enumeration is important. In fact, enumeration should continue throughout the entire pentest. As each vulnerability is exploited, you'll gain additional access, information, and/or privileges, all of which enable additional enumeration.

The tools and techniques outlined in this section will help with the enumeration process, enabling you to gain as much information as possible about your targets, regardless of the current pentesting phase.
