Formatting Standards
====================

This document serves as a reference to how walk-throughs should be formatted via ReStructuredText (RST).



**Asterisks** should be used for things that should appear bold.

* The names of links, buttons, form fields, menu options, etc.
  * Examples:
    * Click the **submit** button.
    * Type the account name into the **Username** field.
    * To exit the program, click **File > Quit**.
  * Menu options use the "greater than" symbol to show sub-menu items:
    * **Edit > Preferences**
* New terms, such as **enumeration**.



`Single-Backtics` should be used for things that should appear italicized:

* Software names (nmap, Metasploit, Apache, ProFTPd)
* Proper Names assigned to targets (Legacy, Beep, Brainfuck, etc.)



``Double-Backtics`` should be used for things that should appear mono-spaced:

* IPs and Hostnames
* Names of files and directories
* Usernames and Passwords
* Commands typed into a terminal or text-entry field (nmap, nc, dirb, ls, etc.)
* Names of software functions or modules



.. code-block:: none

    Code Blocks should surround blocks of code, or text copied and pasted from a command-line. Whenever possible, include the name of the scripting language after the ``code-block`` descriptor, as seen above. This allows for syntax highlighting. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    print("Hello, world!")
